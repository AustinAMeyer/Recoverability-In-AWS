Minimum RTO for a single AZ outage
I would say in this case it shouldn't take more than 5 minutes because we have everything built to work in multiple availability zones.

Minimum RTO for a single region outage
In this case I would expect it to take longer. My total expectation would be around 48 minutes based on my evaluation below:

Problem happens
Takes 2 minutes to trigger an alert
Takes 1 minute to send to all staff
Takes 15 minutes for staff to get out of bed to deal with issue
Takes 15 minutes for staff to diagnose the issue
Takes 15 minutes to remediate the issue

Minimum RPO for a single AZ outage
I would say in this case it shouldn't take more than 5 minutes because we have everything built to work in multiple availability zones.

Minimum RPO for a single region outage
In this case my expectation would be it depends on how often the backups are set to go off. If the automated backups are set to every 2 hours then the minimum RPO would be 2 hours.
